SkySat-3, launched in June 2016 on PSLV, was the first commercial spacecraft to load and fly ECAPS' [ADN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_dinitramide) based green monopropellant known as LMP-103S. Previously the technology had flown on the Swedish Space Corporations [PRISMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisma_(satellite_project)) mission, which launched in June 2010.

## Evolution of SkySat
In November 2013 Skybox Imaging launched SkySat-1 from Yasny, Russia. Eight months later SkySat-2 was launched from Baikonur, Kazakhstan. Shortly afterward Skybox Imaging was [aquired](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/06/11/google-buys-skybox-for-500-million-the-deal-could-be-about-more-than-maps/) by Google and rebranded to Terra Bella. To enhance mission flexibility and increase on-orbit life, the next design iteration of the SkySat platform incorporated a chemical propulsion subsystem. 

## Need for Propulsion
A critical requirement identified in the evolution from SkySat-1 and SkySat-2 towards a full constellation (SkySat-3 thru SkySat-21) was the inclusion of a highly performant propulsion system capable of maximizing available {% katex(block=false) %} \Delta V {% end %} within a tight volume and low power restrictions. The chief capabilities enabled by inclusion of such a propulsion system are:

- Constellation Phase Management
    - Launching multiple spacecraft on a single rocket requires the use of propulsion to phase the spacecraft within each orbit plane and then overcome orbit perturbations to maintain their relative spacing
- Mission Flexibility
    - A high thrust to spacecraft mass propulsion system enables the constellation to take advantage of a wide range of primary or secondary launch opportunities with established providers and emerging new entrants. The ability to correct for large orbit injection errors or accept injection into a wide range of altitudes and quickly absorb those individual launch differences without significant delay to incorporation of spacecraft into the constellationâ€™s product is a tremendous value

## ECAPS System Used on SkySat-3 to SkySat-21
The resulting system was designed and manufactured by ECAPS AB in [Solna, Sweden](https://goo.gl/maps/Ug7F6h8M2tqrdFYY7). It is a fully integrated, modular drop-in to the existing SkySat bus design, which was extended in height to include the propulsion system. 

The system provides a total impulse of approximately 21 kN-s at a satellite internal volume fraction of about 11% and a mass fraction of approximately 10% dry and 19% wet. Four 1N HPGP thrusters are blowdown pressure fed LMP-103S from 3 tanks holding 10.5 kg of propellent total. The schematic and physical layout is shown in Figure 1.

## Cumulative Time in Space
At the time of posting, SkySat-3 to SkySat-15 are operating in-space and SkySat-16 to SkySat-21 are scheduled to be launched in summer of 2020 on SpaceX Falcon 9 vehicles (SkySat-1 and 2 are excluded because they do not have propulsion systems). The total on-orbit years for the ECAPS propulsion systems are tabulated below:
