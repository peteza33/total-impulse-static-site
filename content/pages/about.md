Hello. I'm [Pete Friedhoff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petefriedhoff/). This site is a small side project I've started using a Rust SSG framework to post my ramblings on propulsion, smallsats, and whatever else seems interesting.

## Career
Over the course of my 14 year space industry career I've leaned pretty heavily towards propulsion systems, but my interests are a hybrid of propulsion systems, technical program management, and light software/scripting. 

I particularly enjoy flying new technology in space, and have been able to do so with ECAPS' [ADN-based LMP-103S monopropellant](@/ecaps-on-skysat.md) and Enpulsion's indium FEEP propulsion system [technology demonstration](https://www.enpulsion.com/news/feep-first-successful-in-orbit-demonstration-of-a-feep-thruster/). 

## Work Stuff I'm Good At
A non-exhaustive list of work related skills I'm good at and enjoy doing:
- Scientific computing and data processing with the Python programming language (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, jupyter, etc)
- Automated reporting with LaTex & templating engines

## Work Stuff I'm Learning
Short list of topics I find interesting and am learning more in my free time:
- Web development with Django and PostgreSQL
- Low-level systems programming with the Rust programming language

## Publications
