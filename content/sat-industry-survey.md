The small satellite industry ecosystem has expanded greatly throughout the last decade which makes it a bit tough to keep track of all the options out there for various capabilities. Here I attempt to catalog the various companies operating across bus manufacturing, launch, ground infrastructure, and ground software.

## Introduction
I've recently started working with [Orbital Sidekick](https://orbitalsidekick.com/) to help develop a hyperspectral imaging system to be deployed and operated via small satellites in LEO for energy asset monitoring. While OSK is focused on the design & build of our payload, we're not interested in manufacturing spacecraft and want to leverage all the commercial space infrastructure possible to get our sensors into space and operational. To that end, I've surveyed the industry for commercial solutions to:

- satellite bus manufacturing 
- small satellite launch capability
- ground segment infrastructure for data downlink & handling
- ground software capabilities for mission operations 

This post catalogs all the various options I've found so far, and could hopefully be helpful to others looking for similar information. 

## Satellite Buses
Companies who design, manufacture, and integrate satellite buses are presented below:
